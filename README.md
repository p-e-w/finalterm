# About Final Term

Final Term is a new breed of terminal emulator.

![Screenshot](http://finalterm.org/text-menu.png)

It goes beyond mere emulation and understands what is happening inside the shell it is hosting. This allows it to offer features no other terminal can, including:

* Semantic text menus
* Smart command completion
* GUI terminal controls

# Installation

Final Term is written in [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) and built on top of [GTK+ 3](http://www.gtk.org), [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) and [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx). It requires the development files for the following software packages:

* [Gee](https://live.gnome.org/Libgee)
* [GTK+ 3](http://www.gtk.org)
* [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) >= 1.12
* [Clutter-Gtk](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/)
* [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx)
* [keybinder-3.0](https://github.com/engla/keybinder/tree/keybinder-3.0)
* [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/) _Optional_, for desktop notifications support
* [libunity](https://launchpad.net/libunity) _Optional_, for Unity launcher integration (progress bars)

To install Final Term, execute these shell commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm.git
cd finalterm/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Instructions for Fedora

_**Note:** Jóhann B. Guðmundsson has provided an SRPM for Final Term [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B48uS582CBl8QkZ5UnRiSzhnTVU/edit) (and one for keybinder [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B48uS582CBl8Wjg1ZVI0bXBrLUE/edit))._

The following concrete steps have been tested and work to get Final Term installed and running on a vanilla Fedora 18 system:

### Install prerequisites

```
sudo yum install git cmake vala libgee-devel gnome-common gtk-doc gtk3-devel libmx-devel clutter-gtk-devel libnotify-devel
```

### Install keybinder-3.0

Note that the Fedora repositories only contain the package "keybinder", which is linked against GTK+ 2.

```
git clone https://github.com/engla/keybinder.git
cd keybinder/
git checkout keybinder-3.0
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### Install Final Term

```
git clone https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm.git
cd finalterm/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### "package 'keybinder-3.0' not found"

The keybinder library is installed in `/usr/local/lib/` rather than `/usr/lib/`. On many systems, pkg-config will not by default search for packages there and this error is the annoying result.

To fix it, add `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/` to your pkg-config search path:

```
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

## Instructions for Ubuntu

The following concrete steps have been tested and work to get Final Term installed and running on a vanilla Ubuntu 12.10 ("Quantal Quetzal") or 13.04 ("Raring Ringtail") system:

### Add Vala repository

This is necessary because Ubuntu does not provide an up-to-date version of Vala in its default repositories.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vala-team
```

### Install prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get install git cmake valac-0.18 libgee-0.8 libmx-dev libclutter-gtk-1.0-dev keybinder-3.0-dev libnotify-dev libunity-dev
```

### Install Final Term

```
git clone https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm.git
cd finalterm/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Instructions for Arch Linux

# Acknowledgments

Final Term owes much of its existence to the awesomeness of [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) and [its documentation](http://valadoc.org), [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) and [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx), as well as to those projects authors' generous decision to release their amazing work as open source software.

Much of the knowledge about terminal emulation required to build Final Term was gained from [the xterm specification](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) and the [VT100 User Guide](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/contents.html), as well as from the study of existing terminal emulators such as [st](http://st.suckless.org) and [Terminator](http://software.jessies.org/terminator/).

Final Term's color schemes are generated using the wonderful [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) by Chris Kempson.

Final Term's application icon is a modified version of the terminal icon from the [Faenza icon theme](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228) by Matthieu James.
