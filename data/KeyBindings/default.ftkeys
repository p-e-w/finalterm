# Final Term default key bindings
#
# Entries take the form
#   KEY = COMMAND; COMMAND; ...
# The commands on the right hand side are executed sequentially.
#
# Key specifications must be parsable by Gtk.accelerator_parse
# (https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-Keyboard-Accelerators.html#gtk-accelerator-parse).

# These are global key bindings which work irrespective
# of whether the application window is focused or even visible.
# Global shortcuts should be used very sparingly.

[Global]

F10 = TOGGLE_VISIBLE
F12 = TOGGLE_DROPDOWN


# These are application-level key bindings which work
# only when the application window has the keyboard focus.
